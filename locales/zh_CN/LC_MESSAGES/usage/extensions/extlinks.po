msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This extension is meant to help with the common pattern of having many "
"external links that point to URLs on one and the same site, e.g. links to"
" bug trackers, version control web interfaces, or simply subpages in "
"other websites.  It does so by providing aliases to base URLs, so that "
"you only need to give the subpage name when creating a link."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:16
msgid ""
"Let's assume that you want to include many links to issues at the Sphinx "
"tracker, at :samp:`https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/{num}`.  "
"Typing this URL again and again is tedious, so you can use "
":mod:`~sphinx.ext.extlinks` to avoid repeating yourself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:21
msgid "The extension adds a config value:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:25
msgid ""
"This config value must be a dictionary of external sites, mapping unique "
"short alias names to a *base URL* and a *caption*.  For example, to "
"create an alias for the above mentioned issues, you would add ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:32
#, python-format
msgid ""
"Now, you can use the alias name as a new role, e.g. ``:issue:`123```.  "
"This then inserts a link to https://github.com/sphinx-"
"doc/sphinx/issues/123. As you can see, the target given in the role is "
"substituted in the *base URL* in the place of ``%s``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:37
msgid "The link caption depends on the second item in the tuple, the *caption*:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:39
msgid "If *caption* is ``None``, the link caption is the full URL."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:40
#, python-format
msgid ""
"If *caption* is a string, then it must contain ``%s`` exactly once.  In "
"this case the link caption is *caption* with the partial URL substituted "
"for ``%s`` -- in the above example, the link caption would be ``issue "
"123``."

msgid "To produce a literal ``%`` in either *base URL* or *caption*, use ``%%``::"

"You can also use the usual \"explicit title\" syntax supported by other "
"roles that generate links, i.e. ``:issue:`this issue <123>```.  In this "
"case, the *caption* is not relevant."

"If enabled, extlinks emits a warning if a hardcoded link is replaceable "
"by an extlink, and suggests a replacement via warning.  It defaults to "
