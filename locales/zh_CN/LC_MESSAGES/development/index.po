"This guide is aimed at giving a quick introduction for those wishing to "
"develop their own extensions for Sphinx. Sphinx possesses significant "
"extensibility capabilities including the ability to hook into almost "
"every point of the build process. If you simply wish to use Sphinx with "
"existing extensions, refer to :doc:`/usage/index`. For a more detailed "
"discussion of the extension interface see :doc:`/extdev/index`."
